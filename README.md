# forkify
## Training JavaScript project from the Jonas Schmedtmann learning course.
### It doesn't work as well because I've had problems with Parcel and API Keys, so you can't post your own recipe. But you can find many pizza, sushi, kebab, avocado and more and more other recipes...
I think this project have upgradet me so much, but I wont stop!
