# forkify
## Training JavaScript project from the Jonas Schmedtmann learning course.
### It doesn't work as well because I've had problems with Parcel and API Keys, so you can't post your own recipe. But you can find many pizza, sushi, kebab, avocado and more and more other recipes...
In this project I've learned how to work with:
1) NPM
2) API's
3) AJAX and fetch API
4) How to use modules
and more a lot of other things...
Mainly, I've become better at thinking programmatically.
I think this project have pumped me up so much, but I wont stop!
